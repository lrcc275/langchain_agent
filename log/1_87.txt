I need to perform three tasks: parse EEG data from a text file, process a numpy array to compute peak-to-peak, mean, and variance for each channel, and save both the results and the code. Let's break it down step by step.

1. First, I'll parse the EEG data from the specified text file.
2. Then, I'll write Python code to process the numpy array and compute the required statistics.
3. Finally, I'll save the results and the code to the specified locations.

Let's start with the first task.

Now that the EEG data has been parsed, I'll proceed to the second task: processing the numpy array to compute the required statistics and saving the results.

2. Compute peak-to-peak (max - min), mean, and variance for each channel
3. Print the results
4. Save the results in a (7,3) shaped array to result/1_87.npy
