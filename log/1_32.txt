I need to perform three tasks: (1) parse EEG data from a text file, (2) process a numpy file to compute peak-to-peak, mean, and variance for each channel, then save the results, and (3) save the processing code to a Python file. Let's tackle them one by one.

1. First, I'll parse the EEG data from the specified text file.
2. Then, I'll write Python code to process the numpy file and save the results.
3. Finally, I'll save the processing code to a Python file.

Let's start with the first task.
